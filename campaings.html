              <p>
                We are yet to launch a climate change campaign with our aims to raise awareness about the climate crisis and inspire Africans to get involved in this action by promoting awareness of the altered conditions under climate change and adaptations. We act as Africa for individuals on climate change and sustainability. Everyone can help limit global warming and take care of our planet. By making choices that have less harmful effects on the environment, we are part of the solution and influence change globally. Climate change is real, and it's a defining issue of our time. We are the nation's voice and your vote to push for credible climate action as a role to play in protecting our planet. There have been speaking up about ways to make a difference on climate change without acting. It is not enough to act, We must act now!

              <p>
                AUSP's career for Africa We Want is to link the Agenda 2063 and SGGs to the African Union, which is Africa's development blueprint to achieve inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development over 50 years. We not only focus on Africa's aspirations for the future but also identify the key flagship programmes which can boost Africa's economic growth, transforming Africa into a global powerhouse of the future for Africa to be realized in the next years. We, therefore, accelerate the implementation of the past and existing Continental initiatives of the African Union(AU), which focuses to defend their sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence, eradicating all forms of colonialism from Africa, and promoting International Corporation. As an AUSP organisation, we have a vision for ordinary African citizens to imagine a more positive future.

We have the project of information tables, posters, flyers, table tents and running educational programs that are publicly displayed on our social media platforms. We use any time-bound strategic campaign aimed entirely at increasing our visibility and awareness for any case explaining why AUSP and showing supporters how they can get involved with us. We are open and visible and empathise with others, including those from diverse backgrounds and cultures, we understand social and ethical norms for behaviour and recognise families, school and community resources. Our public recognition is through media, messaging and having an organised set of seminars in different countries every year to achieve a long-term lasting organisation.

                    The Global Campaigns for Education(GCE) is an international coalition of non-governmental civil society movements that aims to end exclusion in education. Public education campaigns play an important role in changing social norms and providing basic factors and education to members of our audience. We are increasing the number of companies which market globally to provide online training courses to our members so that they can grant themselves an opportunity to work in a virtual global team across multiple geographic locations. We are based in coalition with other member organisations working to ensure all youth, adults and children have access to quality education through a broad network. We aspire to be the most powerful campaigning tool for global education at our fingertips, which is free, easy and impactful. We top into our network of millions of Africans fighting for change. Everyone has the right to education.

This is an open forum and movement for change which aims to deliberate on key issues in the African continent. Together we are working to make gender equality in Africa through national and international level meetings which tables meetings to take stock of the achievements, outline the challenges and table proposals on how to create a space for public civilization.

              <p>AUSP Understands that in a rapidly evolving and globalised world, the rights, responsibilities, contributions and opportunities of young people around the world are neglected far too often.  As a result,  both the success of these young people and the success of their countries may be unnecessarily limited.  AUSP believes that young people are the present, and the future and supporting the world's young people is both an urgent and international matter.  Since its inception, AUSP has been committed and dedicated to promoting, educating, connecting and empowering youth in various initiatives to impact the current and future generations in Africa and around the world.</p>
